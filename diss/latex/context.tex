{\bf A compulsory chapter,     of roughly $5$ pages}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
This chapter should describe the project context, and motivate each of
the proposed aims and objectives.  Ideally, it is written at a fairly
high-level, and easily understood by a reader who is technically
competent but not an expert in the topic itself.

In short, the goal is to answer three questions for the reader.  First,
what is the project topic, or problem being investigated?  Second, why
is the topic important, or rather why should the reader care about it?
For example, why there is a need for this project (e.g., lack of similar
software or deficiency in existing software), who will benefit from the
project and in what way (e.g., end-users, or software developers) what
work does the project build on and why is the selected approach either
important and/or interesting (e.g., fills a gap in literature, applies
results from another field to a new problem).  Finally, what are the
central challenges involved and why are they significant?

The chapter should conclude with a concise bullet point list that
summarises the aims and objectives.  For example:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
The high-level objective of this project is to reduce the performance
gap between hardware and software implementations of modular arithmetic.
More specifically, the concrete aims are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Research and survey literature on public-key cryptography and
      identify the state of the art in exponentiation algorithms.
\item Improve the state of the art algorithm so that it can be used
      in an effective and flexible way on constrained devices.
\item Implement a framework for describing exponentiation algorithms
      and populate it with suitable examples from the literature on
      an ARM7 platform.
\item Use the framework to perform a study of algorithm performance
      in terms of time and space, and show the proposed improvements
      are worthwhile.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}
