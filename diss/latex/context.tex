\section{Introduction}

This thesis is a small exploration into the interconnected and mysterious worlds
of mathematical logic and computation. Since the advent of the fields in the
early 20th Century, links have been found in unusual places and advances in one
has helped understand the other. There are two primary focal points of this
thesis, the unification of disparate areas in mathematical logic and computing
via category theory, an offshoot of abstract algebra, and the rigorous
formalisation of mathematics within modern theorem provers. More precisely, a
particular theorem within Category Theory will be proven within the theorem
prover Agda and its applications are explored with a new application provided in
the context of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. \todo{precise contributions}.
Givin the attempts of this thesis to incoporate a large amount of related yet
distinct fields together the contextual history behind the primary areas must be
outlined.
