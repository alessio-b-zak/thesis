{\bf A topic-specific chapter, of roughly $15$ pages}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
This chapter is intended to evaluate what you did.  The content is highly
topic-specific, but for many projects will have flavours of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item functional  testing, including analysis and explanation of failure
      cases,
\item behavioural testing, often including analysis of any results that
      draw some form of conclusion wrt. the aims and objectives,
      and
\item evaluation of options and decisions within the project, and/or a
      comparison with alternatives.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
This chapter often acts to differentiate project quality: even if the work
completed is of a high technical quality, critical yet objective evaluation
and comparison of the outcomes is crucial.  In essence, the reader wants to
learn something, so the worst examples amount to simple statements of fact
(e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y''); the best examples are analytical
and exploratory (e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y, which means Z; this
contradicts [1], which may be because I use a different assumption'').  As
such, both positive {\em and} negative outcomes are valid {\em if} presented
in a suitable manner.
