{\bf A compulsory chapter, of roughly $10$ pages}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
This chapter is intended to describe the technical basis on which execution
of the project depends.  The goal is to provide a detailed explanation of
the specific problem at hand, and existing work that is relevant (e.g., an
existing algorithm that you use, alternative solutions proposed, supporting
technologies).

Per the same advice in the handbook, note there is a subtly difference from
this and a full-blown literature review (or survey).  The latter might try
to capture and organise (e.g., categorise somehow) {\em all} related work,
potentially offering meta-analysis, whereas here the goal is simple to
ensure the dissertation is self-contained.  Put another way, after reading
this chapter a non-expert reader should have obtained enough background to
understand what {\em you} have done (by reading subsequent sections), then
accurately assess your work.  You might view an additional goal as giving
the reader confidence that you are able to absorb, understand and clearly
communicate highly technical material.
