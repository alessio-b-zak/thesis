\section{Martin Lof Type Theory}
The approach to theorem proving taken in this thesis is a type theoretic
approach exploiting the curry-howard correspondence. This will be done in a
dependent type theory designed by Per Martin Lof, a logician working in
intutionistic logic. Martin Lof's type theory, here on abbreviated as MLTT, was
intended to be an entirely constructive foundation in which mathematics could be
done. Just as, inline with the curry-howard correspondence, the intutionistic
fragment of natural deduction has an interpretation within the simply-typed
$\lambda$-calculus, MLTT has a logical interpretation as first-order
intuitionistic predicate logic by including dependent types in the theory.

MLTT adopts the Church-style view of typing in which terms cannot be brought in
without a unique type. This is done by introducing typing as a judgement of the
type theory. The judgements of a theory are the conclusions that can be made
from the theory given the deductive rules of said theory. The judgement that a
term $a$ has type $A$ is written

\begin{align*}
    a: \, A
\end{align*}

The other primary judgement of MLTT is that of judgemental equality. Judgemental
equality is used to introduce new constructions into the theory as definitional
equalities to allow us to introduce and name new constructions and to establish
when two terms normalise to the same term. The judgement that two terms are
equal (at a type)
