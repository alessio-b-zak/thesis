\chapter{The Karoubi Map and Lawvere's Fixed Point Theorem}
\label{appx:karoubi}

Below is a failed attempt to see the consequences of lawvere's fixed pont
theorem after applying the Karoubi Envelope to the $\lambda$-algebra.

As stated earlier every $\lambda$-algebra can be turned into a ccc with a
reflexive object via the karoubi envelope which turns any additive category into
a pseudoabelian category. Let $C = (X, \cdot , k, s)$ be a $\lambda$-algebra the
karoubi envelope is as follows where $a \circ b = \lambda x . a (b x)$.

\begin{align*}
    &\textnormal{Objects}: \, \{ x \in X \, | \, x \circ x = x \} \\
    &\textnormal{Arrows}: \, \textnormal{Hom}(a, \, b) =  \{ f \in X \, | \, b
        \circ f
    \cdot a = f\} \\
    &\textnormal{Identity}: \, \textnormal{id}_{a} = a \\
    &\textnormal{Composition}: \, f \circ g
\end{align*}

This comes from considering $C$ as a monoid which is then categorified as a
category with a single object.

Proofs of the validity of all constructions can be found in (Koymans 1982). To
show cccsness.

\begin{align*}
    &\textnormal{Terminal}: \, t = \lambda x y . y \\
\end{align*}
\ldots

The reflexive object is \textbf{I} as $\textbf{I}^\textbf{I} = \textbf{1}$ where
$\textbf{I} = \lambda x.x$ and $\textbf{1} = \lambda x \, y . x \, y$ where
\textbf{1} is itself the arrow both ways between \textbf{1} and \textbf{I} and
$\textbf{1} \circ \textbf{1} = \textnormal{id}_{\textbf{1}}$.

Via the earlier corollary, every endomorphism on \textbf{I} has a fixed point.
Endomorphisms on \textbf{I} are $\lambda$-terms, $f$, such that $\textbf{I}
\circ f \circ \textbf{I} = f$. Expanding this out
\begin{align*}
    \textbf{I} \circ f \circ \textbf{I} &= \lambda x . \, \textbf{I} \, (f \, (\textbf{I}
    \, x)) \\
    &= \lambda x . \, f \, x
\end{align*}

For this to encompass all (any?) $\lambda$-terms our equational theory must
include the $\eta$-rule. Given that this is a construction is for
$\lambda$-algebras which need not have $\eta$ this rains on the hope that
Lawvere's fixed point theorem will correspond to the first recursion theorem for
the untyped $\lambda$-calculus.

A point to \textbf{I}, $p$, in the karoubi'd category corresponds to $\lambda$-terms such
that $\textbf{I} \circ p \circ t = p$

\begin{align*}
    \textbf{I} \circ p \circ t &= p \circ t \\
    &= \lambda x . p (t x) \\
    &= \lambda x . p (\lambda y . y) \\
    &= \lambda x . p \textbf{I} \\
    &= \textbf{K} (p \textbf{I})
\end{align*}

i.e some constant function.

With this in mind, Lawvere's fixed point theorem ends up representing a
reasonably strange theorem in the untyped $\lambda$-calculus i.e. for every
$\lambda$-term, $f$, that satisfies extensionality there exists a constant
$\lambda$-term, $u$, such that $\lambda x . f (u x) = u$. $u =
\textbf{K}(p\textbf{I})$ for some $p$.

\begin{align*}
    \lambda x . f (u x ) &= \lambda x . f(( \textbf{K} (p \textbf{I})) x) \\
    &= \lambda x . f(p \textbf{I}) \\
    &= \textbf{K} (f (p \textbf{I})) \\
    &= \textbf{K} (p \textbf{I})
\end{align*}
